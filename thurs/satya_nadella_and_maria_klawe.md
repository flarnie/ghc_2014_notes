take micros

we first of all have one of the most diverse portfolios

diff contexts

across geographies

if you look at having diff. perspe.
  that are needed to create product truth
  that really breaks through
  i believe anyone who stands out who has more to contribute
  ..
  that's when you're going to tap into it

  ..
  the first time you break through don't give up
  have some resil.
  it's not going to be easy
  you've got to know that you've got a superpower

- Maria -
when I was in early stages of my career
if I wasn't really really loud
  pushy
  i didn't get heard

and then the funny thing about that
one of the things I recommend to Pooja
don't be as loud as I was
you don't need to be as obnoxious
but you have to be persistant
you often have to repeat what you say
because the first time you said it they didn't hear it

as you get older
...
once you become more powerufl
are given more positional auth
...
people listen to you more
if you are as pushy as you used to be,
  it's seen as 'bitchy'

  had to be loud loud loud, quieter quieter

  There are a lot of women in the audience who are trying to figure out how to have it all

  how can women who have taken a break
  ...
  leave an impression
  grow in their jobs

  what can org.s do to support women in this phase

we see this in microsoft

..
mid-career
women do make choices where they do want to take time off
to make time for family
how do they come back without losing ground

we have an article this week
...
of all the case studies of people

...
i've sat in many round tables trying to undrst what happens there

...
women have lower tolerance for BS
which is ...
they look at the stark trade-off

do I have to put up with this
  or can i just go spend time with my family

  it's imcumbant

  to create an env'where we don't make that tradepff os stark

  what's the way to run a mentoring program and bootcamp all over again
  to place them

  Maria  - I wouldn't call it a bootcamp

I was talking to someone who got his phD in physics
Princeton had a bootcamp for underprivileged people
it was the worst possible way to start

reentry experience
welcoming experience
accelerator

 - guy
 ther eis some real investment that needs to be made
 map people's reentry to be a success

 - Maria
 US of Columbia has a program BA of CS
 can get an up to date BA in CS in two years if you have a BA in anything

 I wish more academic institutions would do something like

 huge need for something to make it easier to reenter the tech industry

 - You were married and you have three children
 ...
 How do you and your wife manage the work life balance?
 what advice would you give to women with similar family conditions and hsubands of ...

 - guy
 it's a challenge
 ...
 somebody was telling me

 calvin everson (fb?)

 one of the things that matters most to her
 as she's tackling this challenge
 as long as her kids know
 that the most import rel in her life is one with her children
 it's not about time or about anything else

 the moments i am there with my children
 ...
 that is the moment I wanna be present
 that is what gives me that harmony
 to be able to carry on
 with what is otherwise a really tough work life balance

- Maria
.. (about her daughter)
it's a job I should not have taken
bc it required
it had a level of stress I had never encountered before
i had a boss that was lying to his board
i was caught in between that
there was an expectation that you work 100 hours per week

i got it back in spades when I had sasha
she was challenging everything
i just couldn't cope with it
after 3 hours of arguing
i'd say I just can't spend any more time arguing

i thought i couldn't give up this job
and continue my career

sasha is 29 now
it's only recently that I think she's fully forgiven me

i'm not suggesting you resign
but if you made it through a year, and it's really really bad
consider it

- guy
on the dimension of this trade-off
am I going to my grave and thinking about the EPS numbers I delivered this quarter
in the full arc of life
what matters is what you have done
esp for those who are closest to you
the worst thing is to have regrets

in my case
i've had a couple of diff challenges
in betwe my wife and me
we have made some tough decisions

i woudln't be able to do what I do w/o the support I got from at home

that's why we foster them
you've gotta work on them

 - Obtained a BA from mangalore university
 further continued studies in the U of W Milwaukee
 (we have some students here from there)
 you also did MBA at U of Chicago

 how old were you when you finished your MBA?
 28

 19 years later he's here)

 as a 28 year old ... did you ever imagine you wuld be CEO of Microsoft

 the entire journey has been surreal to me

 who would have thought a guy from South Asia...

 ... you pick an industry
 that is just an amazing industry
 that gives you amazing opportunities
 and you pick a country
 where one can come from anywhere
 and pursue their dreams
 and achieve them
 that comb is what this world makes available to anyone
 i am the best example of someone who has benefitted greatly from it


 difference between mentorship and sponsoring

 you need someone who truly gives you both great feedback and mentoring
 but also is willing to take bets on you

 and especially when you stand out
 while it's not obv that you are the... canditate for a particular challenge

 you've had breaks where a variety of diff. people

 all the great women leaders I've had a chance to work with

 at a crucial point in my career at microsoft

 ... gave me the harshest most hard core feedback
 settle down and think about the work you do
 and believe in the system
 and that the right things will happen

 just that combination of showing you the meta
 and yet she was giving me the opportunities

 no only giving me the mentoring and harsh feedback
 to truly go chase after what I was really after

 you've been talking about how you've been getting advice from other ceos
 you have tim cook
 larry page
 i'm sure you talk to zuck as well

 share their perspective of how they make things work
