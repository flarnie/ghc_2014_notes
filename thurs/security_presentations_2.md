## Visualizing Privacy
*presented by Morgan Eisler, UX Researcher at Lookout*
@mogasaur

> "Lookout has a consumer mobile security app
> with millions of users.
> ...
> If you have a business,
> trust is important to you.
> Chances are
> your users are interacting with your app using the internet.
>
> More and more people are using the internet
> and using mobile devices.
> That's part of the reason I'm going to focus on mobile solutions today.
>
> **What is a short form privacy policy?**
> ...
> Regular privacy policies [are long form]...
>
> You may be required to have one by law.
> It has to be accurate.
> Users have to accept the privacy policy.
> ###"lt;dr" - Noone reads them.
> According to research
> ###only 12% of internet users [actually read them]...
> ###less than 20% who read them sometimes actually understand them ...
>
> [They] Can be written in dense legal language.
> They might not even be accurate.
> They're long.
> ###Facebook's privacy policy is longer than the constitution of the US.
>
> ###It would take the average user
> ###30 working days
> ###to read every privacy policy
> ###of every website
> ###she visits in a year.
>
> People understand that they have to accept these privacy policies
> in order to get on with their day.
>
> **Why do we care that people don't read privacy policies?**
> If we know that ppl don't read .. or understand them
>   and we know that users know that they have to accept the terms
>   ... Can we really call this consent a choice?
>   And is it actually informed?
>
> That's a question that policy makers are working on.
> Another reason,
> a business reason,
> that has to do with trust:
> Research also shows us that user expectations about
> data collection and sharing don't match reality.
>
> [Web applications] store, ... [and]
> share
> more data
> far more often
> than users expect.
>
> Negative surprises. ...
> Negative surprise can cause loss of trust.
> [Loss of trust can lead to] loss of revenue.
>
> Think about this in light of recent data breeches.
>
> 48% of companies experienced data breech in past year.
> 47% of adults have had their data exposed.
>
> Chances are your users .. have had some experience with this problem.
> They might fear it.
>
> Before you decide that data breeches are only for the targets and home depots of the world,
>
> Think about 'yo'.
> ...
> It was hacked
> overnight ...
> The user's own data was exposed
> and their friend's data was exposed.
>
> This was a couple of people who made an app.
>
> Data breeches are becoming more common
> and not neccesarily for big companies.
>
> **What can I do about this?**
>
> We know privacy policies aren't perfect.
>
> ... Show users a version of your privacy policy that is
> * more usable
> * more friendly
> * more comprehensible
>
> ... called
> a short form privacy policy.
>
> At lookout
> security is important to us.
> We're in security.
> Trust is important to us,
> our users,
> and our business.
>
> We had an existing privacy policy.
>
> We decided to build a better one,
> especially for mobile,
> because that's the direction that internet traffic is going,
> and reading a complicated text heavy document can be particularly egregious,
> on a mobile device.
>
> **What content should you include on a short form privacy policy?**
>
> [Consult the]
> NTIA Code of Conduct for short form privacy policies
>
>  types of data collected:
> - biometrics
> - browser history
> - etc.
> data shared:
> - which 3rd party networks you share data with
> - etc.
>
> We wanted it to be skimmable.
> We wanted people to take a look at this and get the gist,
> and actually take a look at it.
>
> [Their short form privacy policy features]
> an icon for each category of NTIA data,
> [and] an icon with the 3rd party shared with.
> They created a 2nd version with data that wasn't shared represented as grey icons.
>
> **How could we know that our short form privacy policy would meet our goals?**
>
> .. Which one performed better?
>
> .. User test it to find the answer to those questions.
>
> Real Lookout users tested it.
>
> You know what?
> They loved it.
>
> (Seems like they thought the company cared about people's privacy)
>
> Like anything, it wasn't perfect right out of the gate:
>
> One icon wasn't easy to interpret.
> ...
> When people saw these biometrics and other icons,
> people hit the brakes. ... [It was]
> super confusing.
> But the greyed out icons that show 3rd parties that they don't share with;
> that increased trust.
>
> What do we collect?
> Who do we share with?
>
> Savy users understood that they would have to share with the government if they had to.
>
> You can [see it at lookout.com.]
> [It is] mobile responsive ...
> web view.

> It's also been localized.
> We think our transparency should extend to our global userbase.
> We had such a positive reaction to it,
> We belted it out as a toolkit;
> available,
> open source on github:
>
> [private parts][lookout-priv-pol-toolkit]
>
> put it together like a puzzle.
>
>  A few other tools:
> Intuit ([uses a short form privacy policy][intuit-short-form-priv-pol])
> [TRUSTe][truste] and the [App Association][app-association]
> ([blog post by TRUSTe][truste-priv-pol] about their own short form privacy policy)
> ([Privacy Dashboard][act-privacy-dashboard]: a resource by the App Association a.k.a. ACT)
> [They have information to help create privacy policies that are] concise, [and]
> navigatable.
>
> This might feel more comfortable for you ...
> also open source ...
> also available to anyone on github ...
>
> [Mozilla has a template for a mobile privacy policy.][moz-priv-pol-template]
> (And also a set of [privacy policy guidelines][moz-priv-pol-guidelines])
> Maybe you need to start with a long form privacy policy.
>
> Again - open source. ...
> availaable on github ...
>
>  ### * be more transparent
>  ### * inspire trust
>  ### * improve comprehension
>
>   keep in mind:
>  * a short form policy is not a replacement for a full-length privacy policy
>  * make sure that users understand that a short form policy is just that"
