#HCI: Multiple Presentations

## Designing for a Digital City
*Advancing the online presence for a Munciple Government*

**Carolyn Pang, PhD Student & Dr. Carman Neustaedter, Assistant Prof.**

> To talk a bit more about my work,
> designing digital cities
> and how local governments can advance their digital presence;
>
> [Let me give an] overview of the type of research we conduct in our lab.
>
> (She shared a video of connections lab.)
>
> ...
> In today's talk I'll first introduce you to the city of Burnaby.
> ... detail about my recent research study
> that evaluated two award winning government portals.
>
> One key take-away message is this;
>
> Cities are only recently starting to explore how digital technology can connect with their citizens.
>
> Cities were beginning to see digital medium was a channel to interact with and engage with their citizens.
>
> We struggled with keeping pace with deploying ... e-government services.
>
> ...
> We are the 3rd largest city in British Columbia.
>
> [We have received] awards:
> 2009
> best run city in canada
> ...
> 2011,
> 2012,
> record for well run portal
>
> We wanted to offer services to [citizens] online,
> also via mobile devices;
> streamline services... payment.. online.
> Key strategy:
> defining objectives for IT
> and how we would get there.
>
> We created a new enterprise web team
> that would oversee the evolution.
> I took on the challenge of leading the team.
>
> [The] city website contains over 5k pages of content,
> including how we could seamlessly integrate 3rd party applications.
> ...
> Design and development of connect Burnaby portal ...
> [It is the] main source of info. .. for employees.
>
> Long term plan is to offer seamless portal for citizens.
>
> Our employee portal was recognized for design as well as functionality.
>
> Affiliated websites have their own identity and purpose;
> [They are] independant from city website.
> Our team also [was] responsible for making sure UX for all of these websites
> maintained a top priority.
>
> Example: "Heritage Burnaby"
> (She shows the "Heritage Burnaby" site and UI.)
>
> [The] fourth area in our portfolio is social media.
> [We are] just getting our feet wet, [in the]
> early stages to teach employees how to use these tools.
>
> Another large area is mobile initiatives.
> Sadly our site isn't optimized for mobile consumption.
>

> Provide citizens with access to government info on mobile
> devices as use of mobile devices continues to grow.
>
> [We also] design and develop print based online and mobile forms.
>
> Our team isn't doing this on our own or solely in the IT department.
> [We are] collaborating with other departments in the city,
> presenting cohesive web presence.
>
> [Also] collaborating with citizens,
> [in order to better] understand what they need, what they prefer.
>
> ###"[How to] allow others to engage with their community?"
>
> This is a growing field of study.
>
> Best of the web and government achievement awards ...
> looked closely at two award winning portals.
> Which portal design was preferred?
>
> [They] evaluated both devices on both a desktop device and mobile device.
> [This was] especially important because our audience is so broad.
>
> [We] recruited 44 participants, [and] asked them to complete a series of tasks.
>
>  - information seeking tasks (example: finding nearby elementary schools)
>  - service oriented tasks (example: apply for a dog license, pay for a parking ticket)
>  - comm. focused tasks (example: navigate a site to find how to report graffiti, find the city's facebook page)
>
> [We] use a system usability scale (SUS),
> [a] standardized validated questionaire ...
> what it measures is ... the system's efficienty... [and] effectiveness.
> [This was] relatively quick and easy to deploy.  After each set of tasks,
> participants completed the questionaire.
>
> They would then move on to the visual design on the desktop and proceed with the same process.
> We did counterbalance the order to make sure it was well balanced.
>
> Visual designs were preferred on desktop, while textual designs were preferred on mobile.
>
> Overall users had a preference for the visual design on desktop device.
> Grouping services by role (by resident, jobseeker) also helped guide users to
> different subareas within the portal.
> However for mobile designs, we needed to leverage text to make efficient use
> of the smaller screen real estate.
>
> True UX studies need to be competed.
> [It's telling that] two award winning portals ... were rated fairly low on
> the usability scale.
>
> My one message that I hope you walk away with today:
> ###They are still struggling and need to truly leverage more usability technology
> ###to connect with their citizens.

##Accessible Websites Are Always Ugly and Other Myths
**Christine Ingalls; Sr. Software Engineer at Intuit; works on TurboTax Online**

> "[Turbotax is the] USA's largest online tax preparation software;
> approximately 20 million users per year.
> [This presentation will cover] web accessibility with a little discussion on
> mobile accessibility:
> [It will] debunk some of the myths.
>
> [We will also] learn some of the ways to champion accessibility.
>
> I've been working on accessibility for about 5 years.
>
> myths I've run into:
> - MYTH: "Accessibility is just for the visually impaired"
> That's not true.
> The "blind" community is often the most vocal. ...
> In the US the national fedaration for the blind has sued several large
> corporations over websites that are not accessible.
> Those have made the news ...
> ###Accessibility is about removing barriers for all people.
> [That includes] no vision, low vision color blindness, low mobility,
>  auditory disabilities, seizures, learning disorders, cognitive disorders,
>  dyslexia, ...
>
> - MYTH: "Accessible websites benefit only a small percentage of the population."
> ###10% of the population have a disability that affects internet usage.
> With an aging population that's expected to go up.
> 2 million users who use our product could potentially have a disability.
> In addition, many accessibility fixes can help the general population.
> [Accessibility] can help all users navigate a complex website for the first time.
> [For example:] text captions can help somebody who wants to watch something
> without annoying the person in the office next to them.
>
> - MYTH: "Web accessibility is optional."
> It's actually quite complicated
> ###[It] is required by law in many countries.
> ... in the UK there is the equality act of 2010 ...
> also laws in Australia, something called 508
> ... in addition the department of justice is increasingly expanding the
> Americans with Disabilities Act to include websites.
>
> ###It's really the right thing to do. It's inclusive.
>
> Making your website accessible is about being inclusionary.
>
> - MYTH: "Accessible websites are ugly and boring."
> [They are] only boring if they're written that way.
> ... [and] so are many websites that are inaccessibly written.
> [In the past, to be accessible] you had to go to text only - that's pretty boring.
> Today you can use images, videos, and JS and be accessible.
> You can provide captions,
> You can put alt text on your images,
> You can use accessible JS plugins.
> We're starting to use the angular JS library;
> it supports constructs that support accessiblity.
>
> - MYTH: "Accessible is the responsability of the developer."
> ###Everyone is responsible for accessibility.
> developers are very important because they actually write the code, ...
> designers,
> QA, managers,
> upper managers, ...
> Management needs to champion accessibility.
> Customers need to champion accessibility.
> Last year we were contacted by a software engineer.
> She provided us with concise information.
>
> Government and agencies need to provide clear guidelines.
> Right now in the US the guidelines are not clear.
> Vendors ... need to make their technology accessible.
> The majority of flash content could never be made accessible to a screen reader,
> no matter what you did.
> Luckily it has fallen out of favor.
>
> - MYTH: "Using auto. tools to test for accessible is enough."
> There's manual testing and there's automated testing.
>
> [Automated tests are] fast; they examine the code ...
> they cannot access cognitive issues.
>
> What if the alt text is 'image'?
>
> The manual testing depends on the knowledge & skill of the tester.
> It can miss things. We have 1ks of screens. ...
> Manually testing every one is very difficult.
>
> Both methods should be used to complement one another when you're testing for accessibility.
>
> - MYTH: [Mobile doesn't matter.]
> Mobile is coming first. ... gaining marketshare realy quickly.
> Unfortunately many disabled people are less likely to be working than
> non-disabled people.
> [They] may be using a cheap smartphone. ...
> Expecting a mobile site to be as accessible as your main site.
> Some people are even going to argue that your mobile site has to be more
> accessible than your main site.
> ...
> Mobile is something people really need to think about.
>
> - MYTH: "Websites have to be accessible from the start." or "The content that
> isn't 100% accessible shouldn't be published." "Everything needs to be accessible."
> Often there are business realities. If you're doing a beta ...  should it be
> accessible?
> What if you're putting out version 1 of a minimum viable product?
> You should foster a culture of designing for inclusion.
> For your beta it may be acceptable so long as you have a plan to make it
> accessible.
>
> - MYTH: "[All] disabled people use assistive technology."
> ... things like screen readers, jaws, voice-over, braile terminals, voice
> recognition systems
>
> - MYTH: "Good assistive technology can solve all accessible problems."
> It doesn't.
> Many users are expecting your site to have some abilities. ...
> Assistive technology is only as good as the information given.
> It might be the alt text on your image ...
> or if you have 5 'click here' links on this page ...
> doesn't give the user a lot of context to what it's clicking on ...
> ###Assistive technology is great, but
> ###it doesn't solve all of your problems.
> ...
> just turn on voiceover and see what its like to have the screen read to you.
>
> - MYTH: "The most important accessibility consideration is alt-text." or "Just put alt text on it."
> ...
> it's very important ... [But] this concept is very much geared toward people
> with visual impairments, ... not geared toward people with cognitive disabilities
> many people .. the blind community is very vocal and litiguous. ...
> if you'r using your images: Yes use alt text. Use images that clearly convey
> your meaning, so that if somebody can't understand the text next to the image
> will also improve the UX of your site as well as the accessible.
>
> - MYTH: "Just add a text-only version."
> This is not true. First off it's exclusionary. [You] don't want people with
> disabilities to use a different site.
>
> In addition you have to maintain two sites. Who really wants to do that? That
> can be ... cumbersome.
> You still have to make it accessible. Accessibility is more than just
> designing for visual impairment.
> People with cognitive disabilities may .. relate better with images and video.
>
> - MYTH: "The gold standard for accessible is WCAG 2.0."
> [It is] published by the W3C consortium.
> This [, that it is the gold standard], is a myth. There's actually 3 levels of WCAG.
> What level are you meeting?
> Even if you meet all the guidelines, there's many people who can't use your
> website. ... To test to WCAG [is difficult.] ...
> A lot of the guidelines are nebulous.
>
> I work on tax software. Tax content itself is not clear. We still use acronyms.
> ..
> [following WCAG] doesn't make your site accessible.
>
> - MYTH: "Only accessibility experts can implement accessibility fixes."
> [What a] strange idea. ...
> That [creating an] accessible website is really different than creating an
> non-accessible website. ... It's just adherence to good coding standards.
> They just pay attention to putting ids and labels ...
> I'm not an accessibility QA engineer; I'm a general QA engineer. A lot of the
> work is done in house.  You don't need accessible experts.
>
> - MYTH: "Web accessibility is hard to implement and expensive."
> If you design to good standards... if you have an existing site and try to
> retrofit it ...  It can be. ...
>
> Think about the issues you will run into if you don't make your site accessible:
>
> [You] could get sued.
>
> [You] could get bad press.
>
> [You] could lose 10% of your users.
>
> ###Simple easy tests for accessibility:
>   - use a keyboard
>   - check link names
>   - try zooming [in] on your browser
>   - look for bad contrast and use of color to convey meaning
>   - pages with UX issues are probably inaccessible"

## Everyday Extremes: Designing
**WORK IN PROGRESS: I haven't formatted the notes from this last presentation.**

Palantir Technologies

software eng. for 2.5 years

gotten a chance to work on .. interesting crazy use cases

talk a little about the mobile ones we've experienced

even though we've been working w/ things that wouldn't come up in everday life
lessons we can take back
for more gen. princ. for mobile design

  we are an enterprise software co. rather than consumer
  for the gov't
    for commercial
      for non-profit org.s

a lot of general principles
very high level
not a lot of tech. details

What is mobile?
There's a lot of other types of devices
how is this device going ot be used in a mobile context

laptops are designed to be portable
tablets are pretty common mobile devices
wearable tech.
goog glass, smrt watches, things like this

instead of thinking of it as  set grop of devices
...

it's really tempting to say
we have this desktop UI
let's just make it the size of a mobile phone
not just a miniature vers of a desktop

has to do less with the device itself
more with the context it's used in

when you're using a mobile dev.
using it out walking around
going crazy places
doing crazy things
they're going to be encountering all of the things you thought were edge cases
what are the extreme cases for all of these diff. scenarios

it's import. to think about not just the mobile dev.

think about how the dev. is connt. to the rest of the world

it's really going to affect the UX of the rest of the world

Everyday extremes:
user error
the extreme version

i get to tell some stories

.. local law enforcement dept.
provide a mobile interface for the laptops in their cars

actual use case they gave us
a police officer gets a 911 call from a school
they're looking up the school's safety information on the palentir interface

we went down to the dept.

looked at how the police officers were using the devices
you have to press really hard
really hard when the car is moving around
the officers had dev. this technique
they would brace their hands against the sides of the laptop
they would use their thumb to interact
it meant that certain parts of the screen were much easier to use

top and right sides of the screen were much easier to use

but you don't have to be a police officer ... to be making mistakes

the depressing fact about building software interfaces
ousers will make mistakes

with your designs you can help them make fewer mistakes

where are they accurate

where are they inaccurate

...

there's a huge number of platforms that you have to dev. for when designing for mobile
we were tasked for designing for .. panasonic toughbook
these laptops are designed to be .. indestructable
shoot it with a bullet
they need to keep working
they sacrifice a lot of things we like about laptops
they're really heavy
wifi is awful
they have a really customized locked down version of windows
we had to get one specially from the dept.

we got the specs
we didnt have one yet
we knew the resolution was 1024x768
and then we got down and actually put it on a laptop in the car
there was about 100px of chrome at the top we couldn't get rid of
it was way too big

this is not something unique to this particular device
there are so many different sizes
...
really .. impr. to make sure your UI actually work
having bugs ia  a bad ux

if you're testing for a wide variety

  The internet is super useful
  but it's only super useful when you're connected to it

  work w/ disaster relief org.
  team rebacon
  whenever there's a nat. disaster
  tehy're the first people on the scnee
  damage assessment

they create all these damage assessment reports using palantir
if you've just had a hurricane
  we couldn't rely on using the internet really at all
  we had to build as if it were entirely online
  ...
  maybe you go down into the basement
  maybe you're in a tunnel
  this .. happens all the time

break it down into 3 diff. cases

good connectivity - really easy

when your connection is slow or spotty - try to make these features avail.
but there is additional .. work

when you're completely offline
which parts of my app. can I do comlpetely offline

in general the broad overview:
first make sure the user knows what's going on
otherwise they're going to get very frustrated

.. allow them to take action based onthat feedback

maybe it's a spinner
maybe it's a progress bar
it makes a huge diff.

UI feedback
there's a really good blog post called "design for real time"
actually build a skeleton template of what's about to happen
fb does this

it gives the user a sense that 'my action did something'

once you let them know what's going on

...
if .. unreliable
  maybe things are gonna fail
  but maybe the user goes right back into an area with good connection
  letting the user retry that aciton is really impt.

if the conn. is really slow - gave the users to abili. to cancel ind. messages
  if there is no internet, time out and let the user move on eventually

think about
what are the components of the system?

maybe your phone is connected to your smartwatch that is connected to the internet

what are the pressures on this sytem
how can things go wrong

how do we degrade the UI that makes the UX as functional and as

think about the extreme cases
when it comes to mobile your users are going to be encount. these things
on an everyday basis.
