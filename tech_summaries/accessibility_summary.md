##Why Promote Accessibility?

> ###10% of the population have a disability that affects internet usage.
> In addition, many accessibility fixes can help the general population.
> [Accessibility] can help all users navigate a complex website for the first time.

##How to Promote Accessibility?

**Who:** Not just engineers.

**How:** You need good manual testing in addition to automated tests.

Some is better than none - if you have inaccessible content, have a plan to
make it accessible, even if you don't have the resources right now.

> ###Simple easy tests for accessibility:
>   - use a keyboard
>   - check link names
>   - try zooming [in] on your browser
>   - look for bad contrast and use of color to convey meaning
>   - pages with UX issues are probably inaccessible
