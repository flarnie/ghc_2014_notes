#Short Form Privacy Policies
*Based on notes from "Visualizing Privacy"*

*presented by Morgan Eisler, UX Researcher at Lookout*

*at the 2014 GHC*

##What is a Short Form Privacy Policy?
> "Show users a version of your privacy policy that is
> * more usable
> * more friendly
> * more comprehensible
>
> ... called
> a short form privacy policy.
> ...
>   keep in mind:
>  * a short form policy is not a replacement for a full-length privacy policy
>  * make sure that users understand that a short form policy is just that"

##Why?

**Long form privacy policies don't educate users.**

> ""lt;dr" - Noone reads them.
> According to research
> only 12% of internet users [actually read them]...
> less than 20% who read them sometimes actually understand them ...
> Research also shows us that user expectations about
> data collection and sharing don't match reality.
> Negative surprises. ...
>
> ###Negative surprise can cause loss of trust.
>
> [Loss of trust can lead to] loss of revenue."

**Instead, give them some actual information about what information is collected and shared.**

> ###be more transparent
>
> ###inspire trust
>
> ###improve comprehension
