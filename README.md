**Disclaimer:**
These notes are not 100% accurate or complete transcriptions -
I wrote things down as fast as possible, but in some cases the wording
or order might not be exactly the same as the original presentation.

Each document includes primarily direct quotes, with
links to any other resources or documentation available.

## Highlights

###Quotes
>"We're getting our history back,
>which is awesome.
>
>##I'm hopeful.
>##The tech industry ...  If we see the problem we can debug it.  Thats how we roll."

*- Megan Smith, CTO of the USA*

from the [Thursday Keynote Speech by Megan Smith][thurs-keynote-megan-smith]

###Technical Ideas

 * **1. Slowly test new features on live traffic.**

> "I learned; measure everything.
> When you deploy,
> you have visible feedback that everything is working.
> If there is anything that is scary you should be notified.
> ...
> Stop and think:
> how will I test this feature?
> You need to know before you go to production:
>  * what are you testing
>  * how will you test it on staging
>  * how will you test it on production
>  * how will you roll it back"

*- Barbara Raitz (Airbnb)*

 * **2. Try adding a [Short Form Privacy Policy][short-form-priv-pol-summary]**

> "Show users a version of your privacy policy that is
> * more usable
> * more friendly
> * more comprehensible"

*-Morgan Eisler (Lookout)*

 * **3. [Accessibility][access-summ] is easy to do, and it is everyone's responsibility.**

> ###Simple easy tests for accessibility:
>   - use a keyboard
>   - check link names
>   - try zooming [in] on your browser
>   - look for bad contrast and use of color to convey meaning
>   - pages with UX issues are probably inaccessible
